# userscripts

A set of [userscripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript) I've personally written and use.

## Index

- [Bandcamp Nag Block](bandcamp-nag-block.user.js): Suppress the "Time to open your heart/wallet"
  modal on [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com).
- [Startpage Search Results Title Setter](startpage-search-results-title-setter.user.js): Include
  search terms and page numbers &gt; 1 in the titles of Startpage search results pages. Makes tabs
  easier to tell apart and history-based autocomplete more usable.
